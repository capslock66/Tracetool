                    licensed package on all development computers for all developers in the<br>

                    The licensed software may be built into products owned by the licensee,<br>
                    provided that:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The licensed software is only a part of the products owned by the <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;licensee.<br>

                    PRIORITY SUPPORT<br>
                    ----------------<br>
                    For support requests of licensees of the Priority Support option, the author<br>
                    guarantees a maximum reply time of 48 hours, provided that:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The yearly priority support fee was paid.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The support request was sent from an email address, which the licensee<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reported to the author as being eligible to get priority support.<br>
                    The author does not guarantee a fix of a reported problem in any specific time.<br>
                    Only a reasonably helpful reply is guaranteed.<br>
                    The "reply time clock" is suspended during weekends (Saturdays and Sundays).<br>
                    It's also suspended during the author's Company Vacation, provided that:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Company Vacation information is made public on the author's homepage.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The overall Company Vacation duration does not exceed 6 weeks per year.<br>
                    Should the author fail to reply to a properly submitted support request in the<br>
                    guaranteed reply time more than once, the author will pay the licensee a<br>
                    compensation of 200 Euros per missed reply. The summed up compensation payments<br>
                    are limited to (can not exceed) the paid priority support fee.<br>

                    LGPL ICONS USED IN MADEXCEPT<br>
                    ----------------------------<br>
                    The madExcept settings dialog uses some icons taken from the Nuvola icon theme<br>
                    created by David Vignoni (www.icon-king.com). These icons are released under<br>
                    the LGPL license (see www.gnu.org).<br>
                    -----------------------------------<br>

                    <br>
                    SPECIAL LICENSE ICONS USED IN MADEXCEPT<br>
                    ---------------------------------------<br>
                    When using madExcept, some icons are (optionally) linked into your executable<br>
                    file and used/shown at runtime. Some of these icons are again taken from the<br>
                    Nuvola icon theme created by David Vignoni. madExcept includes a special<br>
                    license for these Nuvola icons. madExcept users automatically have a license<br>
                    to use these Nuvola icons without needing to follow the LGPL, as long as they<br>
                    are using the icons only in combination with madExcept. If madExcept users want<br>
                    to use any Nuvola icons outside of the madExcept dialogs, they need to follow<br>
                    the LGPL license again. The Nuvola icons licensed for madExcept are:<br>
