       Do you know this box? ;-) Well, nobody is perfect. So it happens from time
       to time that we programmers ship a product, which is not totally bug free.
       That's okay (more or less), you might say. As long as your product has less
       bugs than Windows, it's fine.</p>
    <p>But what do your customers say? Let's say a customer mails you that he gets
       this "invalid pointer operation" box quite often and that he either wants
       his money back or a new version which fixes this bug. He's willing to help
       you finding the bug, he even sends you a screen shot of the exception box.
       But does that really help much? I don't think so. There's absolutely *NO*
       useful information in that box. And on your computer this bug simply doesn't
       occur, no idea why. So what can you do now?</p>
    <p>What you would really need is more information - a *lot* more information.
       You would need the exact source code location where the exception occured,
       and - also important - how the program got to that location. In other words:
       You need the exception callstack, with unit name, function name and line
       number for each item. THEN you would have good hope to find the bug. Right?</p>
    <p>Okay, the package "madExcept" was exactly build for that purpose, namely to
       replace Delphi's standard exception handling with a new logic, which finds
       out the full callstack with as much details and infos as possible. The exact
       behaviour of madExcept's exception handling can be totally
       <a href="madExceptSettings.htm">customized</a>. You can choose whether you
       want to see an exception box or not, how the box should look like, which
       buttons it should have, how the buttons should be labeled and so on. If you
       don't do any customization, the default box looks like this:</p>
    <p><img src='exc-ss3.gif' align=left style="margin-right:10pt;margin-bottom:10pt">
       The usual customer doesn't really want to read madExcept's detailed bug
       report. He just wants to send the bug report to the programmer, hoping that
       this will lead to a corrected new version. So in the default
       <a href="madExceptSettings.htm">settings</a> madExcept's box doesn't show
       any exception information, not even the exception message itself. The
       customer can just mail the bug report, or he can continue, restart or close
       the application.</p>
    <p>One thing should be mentioned here: madExcept's exception box is *not* using
       any VCL stuff, instead it's build on pure win32 API calls. It's no fun
       designing a nice box with bitmap buttons and so on with win32 APIs only, but
       in this case it was absolutely necessary. The VCL is not thread safe, but
       our exception box must be able to show up in the context of each thread -
       thus it has to be thread safe, thus it must not use the VCL.</p>
    <p>Apart from pure exception handling madExcept does one more thing
       (<a href="madExceptSettings1.htm">if you want it to</a>),
       namely checking whether the main thread is frozen or not. Sometimes your
       program doesn't react anymore, although no exception occured. That can
       happen e.g. if your main thread runs in an infinite loop or if there's a bug
       in the synchronization of multiple threads, with the result of a dead lock.
       Such a bug can be *very* difficult to find, because your program is just
       frozen, without showing an exception. But with madExcept the situation is
       not that hopeless anymore: If your main thread doesn't react on messages for
       a specified time, madExcept raises an exception in the context of the main
       thread. In the resulting bug report you can see what the main thread was
       doing exactly and also what all other threads were doing at that time. That
       should help a lot finding infinite loop and dead lock bugs.</p>
    <p>Okay, I've talked enough. If you now just want this extended exception
       handling, then (after having 
       <a href="http://www.madshi.net/madCollection.exe">downloaded</a> and
       installed the package) please read <a href="HowToUseMadExcept.htm">How To Use madExcept</a>.
       Customization details can be found on the
       <a href="madExceptSettings.htm">madExcept Settings</a> page. The <a href="madExceptFaq.htm">madExcept FAQ</a> page answers some
       frequently asked question. If you want to know how "madExcept" works
       internally in all details, you can head on over to the
       <a href="madExceptInternals.htm">madExcept Internals</a>. If you're interested in a little
       <a href="madExceptDemo.htm">demo</a> that shows "madExcept" in action when
       working with an application & dll combo, continue
       <a href="madExceptDemo.htm">here</a>. Finally, you may be interested to read
       something about the different <a href="TraceMethods.htm">Stack Tracing Methods</a> available on the
       market.</p>
