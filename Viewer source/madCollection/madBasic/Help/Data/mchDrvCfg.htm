    <p>The madCodeHook injection drivers need to be configured and
       <a href="mchDrvSign.htm">signed</a>, otherwise they won't work at all.
       By configuring the driver file, you give it a unique name. Also you can
       make a set of "good" hook dlls known to the driver.
       The driver is only ever willing to inject those hook dlls which are known
       to it, or which are signed with the same certificate as the driver itself.
       Injection of any unknown hook dll is always refused.</p>
    <p>There's a command line tool available named "madConfigDrv.exe". You need
       to call this tool to configure the driver to your specific needs. Here's the
       help output of the tool:</p>

    <p>In order to properly configure a driver, there is only one thing you *have* to
       do: You need to specify a driver name. The name should be unique. I'd
       suggest something like "yourCompanyNameProductNameInjDrv". This name is not
       directly visible anywhere, so don't worry about using cryptical names. The
       name will later be used by the
       <a href="DllInjecting.htm#LoadInjectionDriver">driver API</a> to contact
       your driver. The length of the name is limited to max 39 characters.</p>
    <p>Optionally you can tell the driver which dlls you want to have injected. A hash
       of each dll file will then be stored into the driver file. Each driver can
       store up to 40 different dll hashs. The driver will refuse to inject any dlls
       which are not considered trustworthy. There are 3 ways to make a dll be trusted
       by the driver: 1) If the driver knows the dll by hash (see above), it's of
       course considered trustworthy. 2) Alternatively, any dll which is signed with
       the same certificate as the driver itself, is also "good". 3) Finally, if you
       use the "-cert=some.dll" option, the driver remembers the first certificate of
       the "some.dll" and compares this certificate to all dlls you're later trying
       to inject. Only dlls which match this certificate will be considered trustworthy.
       If you use the "-cert=some.dll" option, dlls which don't match this certificate,
       but do match the certificate the driver itself was signed with, are *not*
       considered trustworthy, anymore.</p>
    <p>Optionally you can also tell the driver to allow being stopped. By default
       the driver refuses to ever be stopped to make sure that a malware application
       can't possible stop the driver behind your back. The option
       "-safeStopAllowed" means that the driver can be stopped only by calling the
       <a href="DllInjecting.htm#StopInjectionDriver">StopInjectionDriver</a> API, but not by using the device manager GUI, nor
       by using "sc.exe". Also stopping will only work if no DLL injection is
       currently active. The option "-unsafeStopAllowed" means that the driver can
       be stopped at any time, by anyone, no matter what. This may make sense if
       you want to use a standard uninstallation software.</p>
    <p>Here's a sample batch file:</p>
    <table width=100% cellpadding=0 border=0>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor=#D8D8D8>
          <table width=100% cellpadding=10 border=0>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor=#F8F0F0><img src='px.gif'></td>
              <td width=100% bgcolor=#F4F4F8>
                  <span id='mono'>
                    madConfigDrv DemoDriver32.sys HookProcessCreationDemoDriver HookProcessCreation32.dll -unsafeStopAllowed<br>
                    madConfigDrv DemoDriver64.sys HookProcessCreationDemoDriver HookProcessCreation32.dll HookProcessCreation64.dll -unsafeStopAllowed<br>
                           </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Please note that the driver internally uses an OS resource which can only be
       used 8 times (up to XP) respectively 64 times (Vista and newer) at the same
       time. That means you need to be a bit careful about how to configure your
       drivers. If you have a dozen of products and every one needs dll injection
       you may run into trouble with the limited OS resource, especially in XP.
       Furthermore other companies are also using the very same OS resource in some
       of their drivers. So you might want to think about maybe using only one
       driver for all of your products. One driver supports up to 40 different
       dlls. Or if you sign all your hook dlls with the same certificate you sign
       your driver with, the driver supports injecting a virtually unlimited number
       of different hook dlls.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that if your driver is not signed with the same certificate
       as your driver, you have to make the hook dll known to the driver. Otherwise
       injection will be refused. Furthermore, in this situation you also need to
       reconfigure and
       <a href="mchDrvSign.htm">re-sign</a> your driver, everytime you even recompile
       the hook dll. A recompiled dll looks like a different dll to madCodeHook.
       Of course if you reconfigure the same driver file again and again, you will
       soon run into the limit of max 40 dlls per driver. So my tip is to always
       start with a "virgin" driver, when you need to reconfigure.</p>
    <p>But really, the best solution is to sign both your drivers and the hook dlls
       with the same certificate. Then you only have to touch the driver when your
       certificate runs out, of when you want to switch to a newer driver version.  </body>
