    <h3>1. Can you please add information "xxx" to the bug report header?</h3>
    <p>Basically yes. However, I only want to add what is useful for the majority
       of madExcept users. If you have a very special wish, which is just useful
       for you, but not for a whole lot of other people, I'd rather not do that.
       Each thing I add to madExcept costs footprint for all madExcept users. So I
       have to be careful about what to add.</p>
    <p>If you think you found a piece of information, which is not yet contained in
       the bug report and which could be useful for a lot of madExcept users, then
       please contact me. I'm always very willing to improve my product(s).</p>
    <p>Please also have a look at how <a href="madExceptPlugins.htm">madExcept plugins</a> work. They might 
       just do the trick for you.
    <h3>2. Could you please list the function parameters in the callstack?</h3>
    <p>I'd love to. And if Delphi would be using "stdcall" as the default calling
       convention, it might even be possible. But as things are, Delphi is not
       pushing the function parameters on the stack (where it would be easy for
       madExcept to grab them). Instead Delphi passes most parameters via CPU
       registers, which makes it difficult if not impossible for madExcept to get
       a hold of them. My disassembler might be able to get a few parameters, but
       only a small part and it would not be very reliable. So I don't have much
       hope for this feature wish. I'm sorry...</p>
    <h3>3. Can you please add feature "xxx" to madExcept?</h3>
    <p>The way madExcept is linked into your executable makes it very difficult to
       implement new features without automatically increasing the footprint for
       all madExcept users. Every feature which can be turned on/off in the
       madExcept settings dialog will be linked into your executable, no matter
       whether you're using it or not. That means, most features when added to
       madExcept will make madExcept's footprint bigger for each and every
       madExcept user, even if he doesn't use the new feature.</p>
    <p>So I have to find a good compromise between adding nice features and
       keeping madExcept's footprint as small as possible. If you think you have a
       wish which a whole lot of madExcept users would profit from, feel free to
       contact me. But please understand that I have to make some tough decisions
       here. So only *really* important things will find its way into the madExcept
       code base.</p>
    <p>However, madExcept offers you some very flexible and powerful exception
       handlers. There's not much that you can't do by simply writing a little
       custom exception handler.</p>
    <h3>4. My forms are not redrawn while the exception box is shown. Could you please fix that?</h3>
    <p>No. This is not a bug, it's a feature... &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Probably you don't
       like this sentence, do you? Anyway, madExcept suspends all running threads
       as long as the exception box is shown. This is meant to stop follow up
       exceptions from flooding you. If you don't like this feature - just turn it
       off in the madExcept settings dialog by unchecking "pause all running
       delphi/bcb threads".</p>
    <h3>5. Why does mailing via MAPI and/or "mailto" not work on some PCs?</h3>
    <p>There are two possible reaons why mailing doesn't work on some PCs. Either
       you just found a bug in madExcept. Or the mail client is not correctly set
       up on those PCs, where it doesn't work. Please have a look into madExcept's
       "tools" folder. There you'll find a little program named "testMailingAPIs",
       with which you can send some test "mailto" and MAPI mails to check whether
       the APIs are set up correctly on a specific PC.</p>
    <p>If this all is too unreliable for your product, no problem. Just let
       madExcept upload the bug report to your web server, or let madExcept mail
       the bug report to you via SMTP - both should be reliable, as long as the
       user's firewall isn't too strict.</p>
    <h3>6. Why does madExcept not work when I use command line compiling?</h3>
    <p>madExcept needs to patch your binary file. When compiling from inside the
       IDE, madExcept's integrated IDE wizard does that patching automatically.
       When using command line compiling, you need to manually invoke the patching
       process by starting the tool "madExceptPatch.exe" after having compiled your
       project. The tool is located in madExcept's "Tools" folder. Please add the
       parameter "-gd" to the command line when calling the compiler to make sure
       that a detailed map file is created.</p>
