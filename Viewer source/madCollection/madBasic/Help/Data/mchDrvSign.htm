    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The madCodeHook injection drivers need to be 
       <a href="mchDrvCfg.htm">configured</a> and signed. If you skip one of these
       steps, the drivers won't work at all.</p>
    <h3>How To Get A Code Signing Certificate</h3>
    <p>For signing you need to have your own Microsoft Authenticode code signing
       certificate. There are several so-called "Certificate Authorities" which
       are offering such certificates. The best known Certificate Authority is
       probably Verisign. Please be aware that some certificates support signing
       drivers, while others don't. GlobalSign and Verisign definitely support it.
       A good value option seems to be
       <a href="http://www.globalsign.com/code-signing/">GlobalSign</a>. They offer
       code signing certificates for relatively affordable 219 USD per year.</p>
    <p>The Certificate Authority usually requires you to provide some legal
       documentation that will validate your company name. If you lack such
       documentation for whatever reason, you can register for a DUNS (Dun and
       Bradstreet) number <a href="http://www.dnb.com">here</a>. Please note that
       the whole DUNS registration process can take months. So if you may need such
       a DUNS number at some time in the future, I'd suggest to go ahead and
       register as soon as possible, as it's a free service, IIRC.</p>
    <h3>Windows 10 SecureBoot compatability - EV certificates</h3>
    <p>Sometimes I hate Microsoft. As if code signing wasn't already expensive and
       complicated enough, now for Windows 10 SecureBoot compatability we need to
       buy the more expensive EV certificates. Furthermore, you need to send your
       EV signed drivers in to Microsoft to have them co-signed by them. Really ugly.
       Alternatively ask your users to disable SecureBoot, then the conventional
       certificates will still work fine.</p>
    <h3>SHA1 vs SHA256</h3>
    <p>Older OSs only support SHA1 certificates. Newer OSs require SHA256 certificates,
       if you don't want to get nasty complaints in Microsoft Edge/IE. Probably the
       only proper solution is to sign with both SHA1 and SHA256 certificates. Or
       alternatively use SHA256, but some older OSs only support that after the user
       applied a patch. Ouch.</p>
    <h3>File Signing Preparations</h3>
    <p>From your Certificate Authority you will get two files: The private key
       ("privateKey.pvk") and the certificate ("certificate.spc"). In addition to
       that you need a matching cross certificate from Microsoft ("msCross.cer"),
       which you can download
       <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/drvsign/crosscert.mspx">here</a>.
       You will also need two tools, both of which are part of the "Windows Driver
       Kit", which you can download <a href="http://microsoft.com/wdk">here</a>.
       The tools we need are "pvk2pfx.exe" and "signtool.exe".</p>
    <p>The two files you got from your Certificate Authority are hard to work with.
       Because of that we combine them into a more comfortable file format
       ("combined.pfx") by using the following command:</p>
    <table width=100% cellpadding=0 border=0>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor=#D8D8D8>
          <table width=100% cellpadding=10 border=0>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor=#F8F0F0><img src='px.gif'></td>
              <td width=100% bgcolor=#F4F4F8>
                  <span id='mono'>
                    pvk2pfx -pvk privateKey.pvk -spc certificate.spc -pfx combined.pfx<br>
                           </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Now on your development PC right click on the "combined.pfx" file and choose
       "install". Your development PC is now ready for signing.</p>
    <h3>How To Sign A Driver</h3>
    <p>In order to sign a file, you can now run the "signtool" on your development
       PC. You need to feed it quite a long list of parameters. Also for the
       timestamping to work correctly, your development PC must have internet
       access. If you timestamp the driver, the signature will stay valid even 
       after the certificate has expired. If you don't timestamp the driver, the
       signature will get invalid in the moment when the certificate expires, which
       is usually not the desired behaviour, so timestamping is recommended. Here
       are the parameters I'm using myself:</p>
    <table width=100% cellpadding=0 border=0>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor=#D8D8D8>
          <table width=100% cellpadding=10 border=0>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor=#F8F0F0><img src='px.gif'></td>
              <td width=100% bgcolor=#F4F4F8>
                  <span id='mono'>
                    signtool sign /ph /v /n "Your Company Name" /ac msCross.cer /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll /d "DriverFileDescription" /du "www.yourCompany.com" c:\whatever\driver.sys<br>
                           </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
