    <h3>various actions...</h3>
    <p>By default <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> <b>automatically saves the bug report</b>,
       but <b>only if the bug report didn't get sent</b>. The sense of this
       logic is that if the bug report got sent to you, there's no reason to save
       it. But if it didn't get sent to you, probably you want to collect all bug
       reports until the end user finally decides to contact you.</p>
    <p>If you want you can tell <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> to <b>automatically send the bug
       report</b> to you. Furthermore you can choose whether you want the sending
       to happen silently/secretly, or whether you want to <b>show an 
       email&nbsp;/&nbsp;upload progress box</b>. Please make sure that your end
       users won't be annoyed by you sending information without asking them!</p>
    <p>Optionally you can tell <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> to <b>copy the bug report to the
       clipboard</b>. This feature is turned off by default, because turning it on
       can mean, that aborting the exception box won't work without a slight
       delay. The reason for this delay a bit complicated: The exception box is
       usually already shown before the bug report is fully rendered. Now if
       the user aborts the exception box, the rendering of the bug report is 
       aborted, too. Of course if you activated this option, <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> can't
       abort the rendering, cause it still has to copy the final bug report to the
       clipboard. Well, most of the time it all doesn't really matter, because
       rendering the bug report takes usually less than a second and most end users
       won't abort the exception box so fast...</p>
    <p>The option <b>pause all running delphi/bcb threads</b> tells <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a>
       what it shall do with the process' threads, once an exception occurs. If the
       option is turned on, madExcept pauses all threads (i.e. the whole process),
       in order to avoid follow up exceptions. Otherwise madExcept leaves all
       threads running, even while the exception box is shown. This option is
       turned off by default because pausing all threads can sometimes (very rarely)
       result in deadlocks. Furthermore when the main thread is paused, the
       application may appear to be frozen, because the forms won't redraw. On the
       other hand pausing all threads does make sense. So it's up to you, whether
       you want to enable this option or not. If you do enable it, please also have
       a look at the function <a href="madExceptUnit.htm#PauseMeEventually">PauseMeEventually</a>.</p>
    <h3>if madExcept is busy while no window is visible...</h3>
    <p>There may be situations where <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> is busy rendering a bug
       report while no exception box is visible. This can happen e.g. if you turned
       the exception box off, or if the user aborted the exception box before the
       bug report was fully rendered (and if the bug report is needed for some
       reason). It can also happen, if exceptions occur in the initialization or
       finalization section of a DLL. If for any of the mentioned reasons
       <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> is busy without a window being visible, do you want to
       <b>show a "please wait" box</b>? Generally this is recommended, because
       otherwise the end user might be confused, if the program doesn't react
       without any visible reason. However, in some situations you might want to
       avoid any boxes to show up (e.g. for server applications).</p>
    <h3>application control...</h3>
    <p>You can configure <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> so that the exception box is closed after
       one minute, if the user doesn't do anything. Depending on in what period the
       last 10 exceptions occurred, madExcept will then either <b>automatically
       continue the application</b> or <b>automatically restart the
       application</b> or <b>automatically close the application</b>. The button
       which is going to be automatically pressed by madExcept after the one minute
       delay gets focused and painted in the form of a progress bar. If you told
       <a href="madExcept.htm" href="madExceptUnit.htm">madExcept</a> to not show the exception box, madExcept won't wait that
       minute, but continue/restart/close your application at once.</p>
